When you wake up in the morning, do you find yourself going through the tedious and boring ritual of checking e-mail, visiting a few websites or blogs, and possibly catching up on Facebook updates?  REWIRE is a novel user experience for bringing all of the information that accumulates while you are away from your computer into one beautiful, easy-to-use application.  REWIRE supports the following sources of information:

  * E-mail
  * RSS feeds
  * Facebook
  * Twitter
  * Weather

By uniting these in one application, you can benefit from:

  * Full-screen interface with minimal interface elements, only you and your information
  * Pleasant bubbles represent e-mails, Facebook updates, RSS items, and more
  * Limited but useful set of actions to help deal efficiently with a large volume of items

REWIRE does not hope to replace your current e-mail program or feed reader.  Instead, it aims to serve as a first-pass tool to reduce the number of items that require dedicated applications to deal with.
Love the bubbles.  They fulfill you.
